# Time-Series-analysis
Very interesting time series machine learning model

This is mainly concentrate on Time Series analysis using tabular datasets.
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) contains :
    
    Daily, Monthly, and Yearly sales
    
    Finding the outliers of the data using Qunatile way
      
    Stationary calculation, Auto Correlation Function (ACF), and Partical Correlation Function (PACF)
    
 2. Models I Used for the Time Series Analysis
 
    ARIMA,
    SARIMAX
    
    Linear Regression
    
    Random Forest Regressor
    
    Decision Tree Regressor
    
    Gradient Boosting Regressor
    
    Ada Boost Regressor
    
    XG Boost
    
    K Neighbors Regressor
    
    Support Vector Regressor
    
    LSTM
